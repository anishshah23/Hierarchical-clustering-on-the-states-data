# Hierarchical-clustering-on-the-states-data
Applying unsupervised clustering technique (Hierarchical clustering) on the states.
hierarchical clus- tering on the USArrests data.
(a) Using hierarchical clustering with complete linkage and Euclidean distance, clustered the states.
(b) Cut the dendrogram at a height that resulted in three distinct clusters.
(c) Hierarchically clustered the states using complete linkage and Eu- clidean distance, after scaling the variables to have standard deviation one.
(d) What effect does scaling the variables have on the hierarchical clustering obtained? In your opinion, should the variables be scaled before the inter-observation dissimilarities are computed? Provide a justification for your answer.
